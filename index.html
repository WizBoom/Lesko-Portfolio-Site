		<h3>I've done some p cool stuff in the past</h3>
		<p>
			I am currently working as a student web developer doing menial and boring tasks using the shitty cms that is wordpress and a little bit of php development. I've been in this position for like over a year now and made a couple cool things, but mostly just updating peoples pages because they're to fucked to do it themselves. Prior to that I worked doing print stuff at a crappy office supply store / print shop, and before that I did some dumb IT, mostly running cables and looking at memes while imaging computers. I've also worked with programming and design shit for some time. All in all, I have no idea what I'm truly doing and just trying to make rent so plz hire me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
